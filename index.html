<h2> <strong> Current State </strong> </h2>
<p> Current technical drawings are arranged to allow electrical engineers to wire circuits correctly. <br> They are static which has certain utilities, but does not allow for quick assessment of trends or anomalies that may be occuring in circuits over time. 
<br> An example one line diagram for schematic wiring looks like this: </p>

<p> This diagram is from a switching station at Clemson University.
<br>The large grid includes all the information you may want when designing and implementing a power grid, but none of the real world usage data that is collected over time.
<br> If we wanted to identify where the highest voltage or wattage is being pulled, you cant identify that information quickly. Data is usually compiled with Microsoft Excel and includes several columns with thousands of rows. </p>

<br>Our paper discusses visualization techniques that allow for proper data comparison that highlights trends and anomilies in power grid design for real world application. 
<br> In current real world application, the nodes are arranged in order of typical power flow, which means the links and nodes are static and provide no information. 
<br>Modeling our visualization off the techniques used in the paper linked above, the links are changing length based on fifteen minute current (A) values. The higher the current, the longer the link will be. 
<br> To emphasize the relationships between the nodes (and for the purposes of testing the code while writing it), the link length, colors, and node size all represent the current flowing between the nodes. 
<br> Other data options are real power (kV) and reactive power (kVA) which have also been collected at the same time stamps. Utilizing these values together in a node graph allows us to study more trends and can show any issues or need for future construction.
