<h1 class= "solid">How can changing the visulization allow us to better answer questions using powergrid analytics? </h1>

<h2>Current</h2>
<p>This is where an explanation of why we want to do that would go. 
<br>This would say something about how to the current use of powergrid analytics is difficult to read because it is all uniform size.
<br> that is great when you are looking to change the system and build. 
<br>A single line isn't too bad.</p>
<img align: "left">
<p>But looking at a large grid gets hard to read very fast. If we wanted to identify where the highest voltage or wattage is being pulled, you cant identify that information quickly.</p>

<h3>Improved</h3>
<p>At this point I think it would be cool to go to a different page by clicking a button that says </p>

<button id="boring" onclick="swap();"> Make It Better </button>

<br> and then I can change to a different page with a better style that has more colors and isn't just white and black to show how white and black is boring and color is better.
<br> that sheet would have like different sizes and better fonts </p>

<p> Date: <span id="date"></span></p>
